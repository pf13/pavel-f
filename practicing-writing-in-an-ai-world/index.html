                <p><em>And why writing still matters</em></p>

                <p>Generative AI tools have already made our lives much easier. If you need to write something simple, you don't need to spend hours formulating a social media update, blog post, or invitation.</p>

                <p>However, writing is even more important in the AI era because it sharpens thinking and resists bias.</p>

                <p>A well-written executive letter is similar to a well-cooked prompt. It works better, helps you formulate a better thesis, and produces much better output in general — you clearly gain an advantage among your peers.</p>

                <h2>Writing as a Tool for Thinking</h2>

                <p>I find that 15 minutes in Google Docs or with paper and pen helps me understand difficult topics, speak more clearly, collaborate more effectively, and — most importantly — resist confirmation bias by cultivating independent thought. It's easy to agree with everything ChatGPT says and push it straight into production, but a well-formulated thesis is a powerful antidote.</p>

                <p>The problem with LLM-generated writings is not the quality of the writing itself. Instead, it weakens your own writing skills and degrades your communication skills. Writing is a muscle that should be trained constantly. To improve your writing skills, you can sign up for a creative writing course, hire a coach, or spend dozens of hours reading books and articles on how to write better. But personally, I think the real key is consistent practice and a strong feedback loop.</p>

                <h2>Building a Writing Linter</h2>

                <p>When I was a QA engineer, I regularly used code linters — tools that automatically flag errors or style issues in code. But I've noticed there aren't really equivalent tools for writing.</p>

                <p>I decided that I need something similar. It might be a day-to-day coach who evaluates my texts, and instead of fixing them on the fly (like Grammarly, or ChatGPT) highlights parts with unclear ideas, vague language or unnatural narrative for native speakers. Once again, highlight and push me to rewrite, rather than fix automatically.</p>

                <p>The solution is simple: Text Linter + Writing Coach in ChatGPT. If it works, it can be a good prototype for a future product.</p>

                <h2>So here's what I've done</h2>

                <p>First, I've created a new project in ChatGPT and collected texts that I really like for their language, grammar, and style. In my case, I've uploaded annual letters from Warren Buffett, Paul Graham's articles, Andrew Wilkinson's newsletter, and many other things.</p>

                <p>Then, I've prepared two prompts.</p>

                <p>The first prompt provides general observations and recommendations on texts that I saved in the project folder in terms of language, grammar, and narrative. It will not change or generate anything automatically. It will push you to rewrite and finish your text, line after line.</p>

                <p>The second prompt goes paragraph by paragraph and explains what it means. Here, I'm trying to check that my thought comes through clearly. This is another good exercise for examining your writing from different angles.</p>

                <p>I'll share both prompts at the end of the article.</p>

                <p>The idea is not new — for example, Sunsama's founder Ashutosh Priyadarshy recently <a href="https://twitter.com/thepriyadarshy" target="_blank">shared similar ideas on Twitter</a>, and I've seen multiple discussions that it helps different people. This post is no exception — I revised it many times using the same approach.</p>

                <h2>The Art of Revision</h2>

                <p>As stated in the book "The Art of Revise", or keeping in mind the approach of Troy James Weaver, you can revise your text relentlessly. Sometimes even too much. Troy's approach lies on the other side of normality – write, read, correct, delete, and repeat the cycle endlessly. At some point, you have to stop revising and hit publish.</p>

                <p>So practice, write, and enjoy clear thinking, but don't overdo it.</p>

                <h2>The Prompts</h2>

                <h3>Prompt 1: Writing Mentor</h3>

                <pre><code>You are a skilled writing mentor who helps writers improve their craft by analyzing their work against exemplary texts. Your role is to provide constructive feedback that helps develop clearer, simpler, and more effective writing.

Your Task
Analyze the user's writing by comparing it to reference texts from accomplished authors (located in the project folder). IMPORTANT: Use these reference texts ONLY as style examples - study their writing techniques, sentence structures, clarity, and flow. DO NOT use their content, meaning, or subject matter for comparison. Focus solely on HOW they write, not WHAT they write about.

Your goal is to help the user achieve similar stylistic qualities (clarity, simplicity, natural flow) while maintaining their own unique voice and content.

Analysis Framework
1. Initial Assessment
   • Read the user's text carefully
   • Identify the genre, tone, and apparent intent
   • Note the overall structure and flow
   • Analyze stylistic elements

2. Comparative Analysis
   • Compare specific passages to similar stylistic moments in the reference texts
   • Focus on writing techniques, NOT content or meaning

3. Recommendation Format
Line from user's text: [Quote the specific line or passage]
Observation: [What you notice about this line - areas for growth]
Reference comparison: [Brief example from reference texts showing effective STYLISTIC technique]
Suggestion: [Specific recommendation for improvement]
Possible approach: [Offer one potential revision as an example]

                <h3>Prompt 2: Writing Clarity Checker</h3>

                <pre><code>You are a writing clarity checker and "linter" for text analysis. Your role is to help writers sanity-check their work by examining individual sentences, paragraphs, or sections for clarity, purpose, and effectiveness.

Your Task
Analyze the provided text segment and provide (do the check paragraph by paragraph):
1. Main Point Summary: What is this text actually saying?
2. Clarity Check: Is the meaning clear and unambiguous?
3. Purpose Assessment: What function does this text serve?
4. Potential Issues: Flag any problems
5. Reader Experience: How would a typical reader interpret this?

Response Structure
Main Point: [One clear sentence summarizing what this text communicates]
Clarity Status: [Clear/Somewhat unclear/Confusing + brief explanation]
Purpose: [What this text does functionally]
Issues (if any): [Specific problems that might confuse readers]
Reader Interpretation: [How readers would likely understand this]
Quick Fix (if needed): [Brief suggestion if there's an obvious improvement]
